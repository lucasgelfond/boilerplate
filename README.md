Stack that I feel comfortable with, to make dev on personal projects easier. Hoping to keep this maintained so I can easily start projects without any setup. 

Right now:
- Next 14.1.1 and React 18
- styled-components and basic themeing
- ESLint/Prettier config

Possibly (depending on if I use) will add Node/Express/Supabase setup here, and/or Radix stuff. But for now, a start!
